**Step 1: Download the Python Installer binaries

Open the official Python website in your web browser. Navigate to the Downloads tab for Windows.
Choose the latest Python 3 release. In our example, we choose the latest Python 3.7.3 version.
Click on the link to download Windows x86 executable installer if you are using a 32-bit installer.
In case your Windows installation is a 64-bit system, then download Windows x86-64 executable installer.

Once the installer is downloaded, run the Python installer.
Check the Install launcher for all users check box. Further, you may check the Add Python 3.7 to path check box to include the interpreter in the execution path.
